    "text": "My overall goal is to analyze this Netflix dataset is to: 1. Detect a word in a description, such as family, love, and friend, and compare how many times it appears in certain genres and compare it with others. 2. See how long descriptions are in comparison to movies/shows that have actors that start with T or A followed with a vowel to those that don’t.\nHopefully these graphs can show something useful but due to this dataset being only around ~8000 rows and my observations being very specific may lead to little to no results."

    "text": "Final Visuals\nI created three graphs located below answering my questions at the beginning.\n\nCount of Word in Netflix Movie Descriptions by Genre\nIn this data set, about movies, we can see that the word “love” is mentioned the most in the description of comedies and least in Action & Adventure. Friend is mentioned the same amount of times throughout the three genres. Family is mentioned the most in Comedies and Dramas and the least in comedies.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nggplot(netflix_movies_filter, aes(fill = keyword, y = count, x = listed_in)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\", stat = \"identity\") +  \n  labs(title = \"Count of Word in Netflix Movie Descriptions by Genre\",\n       x = \"Genre\",\n       y = \"Count of Keywords\",\n       fill = \"Keyword\") +  \n  theme_minimal()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCount of Word in Netflix Shows Descriptions by Genre\nIn this dataset, about shows, the most insightful thing we see is that love is mentioned the most in Dramas and comedies in comparison to Action & Adventure.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nggplot(netflix_shows_filter, aes(fill = keyword, y = count, x = listed_in)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\", stat = \"identity\") +  # Grouped bars\n  labs(title = \"Count of Word in Netflix TV Shows Descriptions by Genre\",\n       x = \"Genre\",\n       y = \"Count of Keywords\",\n       fill = \"Keyword\") + \n  theme_minimal()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription Length in Comparison with Actors starting with T or A\nSince the boxplot isn’t that different between each other, we can make grand observation. One thing to note is that cast labeled as N/A has very short descriptions.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(netflix_titles, aes(x = as.factor(actor_TA), y = description_length, fill = as.factor(actor_TA))) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Description Length in Comparison with Actors starting with T or A\",\n       x = \"Contains 'T' or 'A' in Cast\",\n       y = \"Description Length\",\n       fill = \"Contains 'T' or 'A' \") +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\")) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\nOverall, I feel like I can gain more insight if I use multiple words and more genres. The word “love”, “family”, and “friend” is very specific and that makes it so our histograms are so small. It would have been better if I used more generic words or used a variety of words. On the counterpart, when looking at actors that start with T or A, I need to be more specific so I can see a difference between the two groups.\n\n\nReference\nI got my data set from the tidy tuesday website/section on github. Found at:\nhttps://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-04-20/readme.md"
