My name is Leonardo Torres, a junior at Pomona College majoring in Computer Science and Minoring in Math + Data Science. I am involved at the Draper Center where I coordinate two programs, Pomona Partners and Pomona College For Youth Success (PAYS).I enjoy being involved with affinity groups on campus and love spending time engaging with the community. I am also an officer with the 5C Club LatinX in Tech (LIT).


This past summer I spent the time doing research with Professor Eleanor Birrell under SURP. The paper we worked on is titled: Evaluating a Data Fiduciary Standard for Privacy: Developer and End-user Perspectives.
