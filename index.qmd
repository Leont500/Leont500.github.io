My name is Leonardo Torres, a junior at Pomona College majoring in Computer Science and Minoring in Math + Data Science. I am very involved at the Draper Center where I coordinator two programs, Pomona Partners and PAYS. I enjoy being involved with affinity groups on campus and love spending time engaging with the community. I am also an officer with the 5C Club LatinX in Tech (LIT).
